  task  c accepts four file names as command line arguments  the first is input file
   and the others are output files   Read byte by byte from the input file and write to the
   proper output file  Alphabetical characters letters write to a file called alpha  numerical
   characters write to a file called num and other characters go to a file called other

   create an error function for ease of writing in the main function
 void err sys char  str 
  
  printf   s n   str  
  exit    
  
 
 int main int argc  char  argv   
  
  umask    
  char buffer 
  if argc    
   err sys  Name exactly   files    
 
    create file descriptors
  int in  a  n  o    input  alpha  num  other
  if  in   open argv     O RDONLY       
   err sys  Error opening input file    
  if  a   open argv     O RDWR   O CREAT                file mode rwxrwxrwx
   err sys  Error opening alpha file

   err sys  Error opening num file    
  if  o   open argv     O RDWR   O CREAT             
   err sys  Error opening other file    
 
    read input file byte by byte
  while  read in   buffer          
   
   if buffer      n     put the new lines in the files
    
    write a   buffer     
    write n   buffer     
    write o   buffer     
    
     the input file is an ASCII file  so we can convert the     digit
     ASCII numbers into characters
     which makes it easier to define a range of characters
 
     detect if the character is a letter and write to alpha
   if  buffer     a     buffer     z       buffer     A     buffer     Z   
    write a   buffer     
   else   put a space in alpha if not a letter
    write a          
     detect if the character is a number and write to num
   if buffer           buffer        
    write n   buffer     
   else
    write n          
     detect if the character is neither a letter or number and output to other
   if  int buffer           int buffer           int buffer           int buffer       
    write o   buffer     
   else if  int buffer           int buffer           int  buffer            int buffer        
    write o   buffer     
   else   if not special character  put a space
    write o          
   
 
    close the files once done
  close in  
  close a  
  close n  
  close o  
 
  return
